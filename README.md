# Captor

##WARNING: This code was built at a hackathon, therefore it is the most convoluted and messy code you will ever see. I am cleaning it up as you read this sentence! 

If you would like to contribute, check out the issues of this repo and try to fix one!

##What is this?
  Automatic subtitles for the deaf using Google Cardboard. You can check out a video demo of it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iE2NuSeD9c)

Built at YHack 2014 by Stefan, Fisher, Sashank and Alex.

We used CardAR for the augmented reality portion of this hack. It is awesome. To find out more about it, [go here][0]. 

This is an augmented reality hack that allows deaf people the ability to see subtitles in real life as they are speaking with somebody. We used Google's speech recognition to continously recognize speech and produced subtitles with it.
